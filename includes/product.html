			<p class="card-text">
				Backflows are used to protect potable water from contamination or pollution caused by a significant change in the pressure of a water system. The water pressure may abruptly change with a pipe burst, pipe freeze or an unexpected high demand is put on the system.

				Cathodic is a means of preventing your pipeline system from reacting with the environment and corroding. Cathodic protection prevent oxidation by converting a active (Anodic) metal surface into a passive (Cathodic) one by diverting current away from the structure.

				Enclosures are most often used for Backflows, they help provide protection from thieves and vandals as well as the environment. An enclosure can either be a cage or fully covered, the covered enclosures also help provide insulation to your backflow. Enclosures are typically made of Aluminum or Fiberglass.

			<h1 class="card-title">Fire Protection</h1>
			<p class="card-text">
				Active fire protection relies on a whole system designed to help fire departments in controlling or extinguishing fire. Water for this system is typically drawn from a municipal water main into a dedicated fire line, which will have a backflow to protect potable water. Pumps may be installed to boost the water pressure if it drops. A hydrant or standpipe is connected to in order to access the water, these can either be wet barrell (pressurized) or dry barrell (non-pressurized).

			<p class="card-text">
				Fittings are an integral part of your piping system. Fittings are needed in order to connect, split and bend otherwise straight lines of pipe. They are also used to reduce or increase pipe which can help regulate the flow. Fittings can be made of Plastic (ABS, PVC, HDPE), Steel (Carbon, Galvanized, Stainless), Class, Brass, Ductile Iron.

			<p class="card-text">
				HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) is a strong, durable, flexible and lightweight material made out of petroleum. HDPE is assembled by the process of fusion, so the need for fittings can be eliminated, making it leak free. HDPE also has a long lifespan due to it being corrosion and chemical resistant.

			<p class="card-text">
				Meters are used to monitor the flow of water in a particular portion of a system, they can be installed at the source or at any part of the line. Meters can help you detect leaks within a distribution network, which can help reduce the amount of water that does not make it to the customer.

			<p class="card-text">
				Selecting the right pipe can become a pretty complex process, but if you take a few things into consideration  you can make a well informed decision. First know what type of line you are working, drinking water needs different material than a wastewater line. If the system is under pressure, you would want to exclude clay and for the most part concrete pipe (both are suitable for gravity flow systems though). The environment and soil conditions need to be considered as well in order to select the material that is most resistant to corrosion. .

			<p class="card-text">
				Whenever gravity is not strong enough to meet the demands of a system, pumps are used to help increase that flow. Pumps are put into two main categories: centrifugal and positive-displacement. For waterworks, the most common type of pump is a centrifugal pump as they are ideal for transferring low viscosity fluids to a higher flow rate.

				Service brass is used to make a connection from the main line to the custom. A service saddle and corp stop are used to tap into the mainline and tubing or pipe can be connected to the other end. Before this connection is made to the service pipe, a curb stop is installed. The curb stop is used to control the water supply from the mainline into the building.

				Valves are used to help regulate or direct flow of fluid within a system by opening, closing or partially opening them. A valve can be a simple as check valve which is simply pushed open by the flow of fluid in one direction, or they be part of complex automated control valve system designed to regulate the pressure and flow downstream.

				Whether water is intended for drinking, irrigation, industrial water supply or water recreation it will go through some type of treatment to improve the quality if it. This process will be different depending on the intended use, but usually involves the removal of contaminants and undesirable material or a reduction in their concentration.
