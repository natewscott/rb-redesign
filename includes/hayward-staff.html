				Rick is thrilled to be a part of R&B Company!  He is a Bay Area native, born and raised in Fremont, California.
				Rick’s experience in the industry spans 35+ years, learning from his grandfather and father through the family waterworks business, Groeniger & Company, founded in 1949.  It was here that Rick gained his strong knowledge of product, sales, and established his value of customer/vendor relationships.  After selling their business in 2011 to Ferguson Enterprises, Rick continued his work as Branch Manager for their Hayward location, until joining R&B in January 2018.
				Rick currently resides in Livermore with his family.  He and his wife, Alecia, married in 1993 and have two children, Garren and Grace. Rick has a long standing passion for automobiles, especially those that are vintage.  During his spare time, he can often be found working under the hood of an old car, although he prefers to be racing one! He also enjoys watching sports, traveling, and spending time with his family and friends.
